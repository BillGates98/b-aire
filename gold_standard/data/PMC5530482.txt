We have previously shown that miR-193b mediates apoptosis through targeting of mcl-1,12 and the overexpression of uc.158âˆ’ in HCC nicely fits with these data as well as with the previous work that found downregulation of miR-193b in a subgroup of HCCs.39 40 It is increasingly recognised that cancer cells rely on a complex network of transcripts generated from coding and non-coding genes, and that interplay of different RNA classes drives cancer progression more than a single aberration.46 However, identification of a single molecule representing the activation of a network may prove more useful for the identification of therapeutic targets and for the implementation of screening technologies to be adopted for targeted therapy.
