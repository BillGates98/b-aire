There was no correlation between mercury concentrations in leaves and mercury concentration in soils for any of the four measurement periods (April–November).Based on the analysis of the transfer coefficient, it was found that high concentrations of mercury in the examined trees were the result of mercury coming from the particulate matter adsorbed on leaves of both tree species, mercury associated with gas exchange through the stomata and its further accumulation in leaves.When comparing the past and current results of mercury concentration measured in soil and plant samples, it was noted that the values for the area of Poznań have decreased recently.
