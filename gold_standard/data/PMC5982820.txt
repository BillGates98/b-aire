The RABV measures can be coupled with the assumptions of Desta and Ortiz (2014); Heffner et al. (2010); and Lorenz et al. (2011) suggesting genomic selection is predicted to facilitate a reduction in the breeding cycle time of the average wheat breeding program of at least half due to the ability to select at earlier generations and also in off-season generations.
