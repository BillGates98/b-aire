Finally, we believe that our work shows that MR imaging can be safely used in treatment planning of radiotherapy for the head and neck; given its enhanced soft tissue delineation, it will provide an excellent tool for more discriminate contouring as we implement novel radiotherapy methods, such as intensity‐modulated radiotherapy. (18)  The work also shows that “discrepancies” seen in perceived structure or tumor delineation in soft tissues can be assumed to be due to the imaging capabilities of the media in question rather than phantom effects from the registration process itself.
