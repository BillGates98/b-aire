The PRIME study has evaluated the predictive value of a range of theories across different behaviours (prescribing antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections, or URTIs, taking dental radiographs, placing preventive fissure sealants), target professional groups (primary care doctors, dentists), and contexts [17,19,20,37]; we have demonstrated that different constructs predicted different proportions of the variance in the intention and behaviour.
