Effect of siRNA targeting of DMT1 (closed bars) and Dcyt B (open bars) on iron uptake in HuTu cells. HuTu cells were transfected with siRNAs and, after 3 days, the cells were incubated for 1 h in BSS supplemented with 10 ÂµM Fe as soluble Fe(II) (ferrous sulphate) or LM Fe(III) poly oxo-hydroxide (nano Fe) plus a further 23 h in fresh, non-supplemented MEM to allow for ferritin formation.
