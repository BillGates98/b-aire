Filtering for movement artifacts and improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of an  in vivo  time-lapse video (acquired at 15 fps) of the mouse brain taken through a skull window preparation. The original video (left panel) is compared with videos subjected to double filtering using the 3-neighbors filter (middle) or double filtering using the 3-neighbors filter followed by a Kalman filtering (right panel).
