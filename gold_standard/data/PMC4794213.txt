Effect of Schizophrenia on Spectral Power as Data is Transformed from Voxels to Networks to Meta-States SZ effects on the spectral power for inputs (Columns 1â€“4) to the meta-state dynamic connectivity framework and its output (Column 5) (red indicates positive correlation with SZ); (Column 1) (A) SZ effects on network TC spectra; (F) Effects from (A) that survive FDR correction at 0.05 significance level; (J) SZ effect on average spectral power over all network TCs; (O) Effects from (J) that survive FDR-correction at 0.05 significance level; (Column 2) (B) SZ effect on windowed network TC spectra; (G) Effects from (B) that survive FDR-correction at 0.05 significance level; (K) SZ effect on the average spectral power over all windowed network TCs; (P) Effects from (K) that survive FDR correction at the 0.05 significance level; (Column 3) (C) SZ effects on wFNC network-pair correlation spectra; (H) Effects from (C) that survive FDR-correction at the 0.05 significance level; (L) SZ effect on average spectral power over all wFNC network-pair correlations; (Q) Effects from (L) that survive FDR-correction at the 0.05 significance level; (D) SZ effects on tICA correlation pattern TCs; (I) Effects from (D) that survive FDR-correction at the 0.05 significance level; (M) SZ effect on average spectral power over all tICA correlation pattern TCs; (R) Effects from (M) that survive FDR-correction at the 0.05 significance level; (E) SZ effect on spectral power of the timeseries that is '1' when a five-dimensional meta-state changes to a different meta-state and '0' otherwise; (N) Effects from (E) that survive FDR-correction at the 0.05 significance level; All diagnosis effects and p-values are from the regression model specified in the Methods section.
